# Emerald Rogue → Showdown

A web tool that extracts team information from your Emerald Rogue (EX) savefile in
a way that can be imported in [Pokémon Showdown's](https://pokemonshowdown.com) teambuilder.

## Getting started
 1. Save the game (to export your current run team, use the REST option in the menu)
 2. Locate your .sav/.srm file
 3. [Open the tool](https://gvirtu.github.io/er2s)
 4. Copy the generated team to clipboard
 5. Create a new team in Pokémon Showdown, and choose "Import from text".

## Limitations

This was not tested extensively yet so it may not work in some cases.

Not all hold items may be valid for Showdown.

Also, at the time of writing, Showdown will always assume all moves have max PP.
